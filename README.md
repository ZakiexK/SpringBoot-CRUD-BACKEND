# SpringBoot-CRUD-BACKEND
The Spring Boot CRUD backend is a lightweight solution for backend applications with basic CRUD operations. It simplifies database interaction, offers user-friendly APIs, and leverages Spring Boot's auto-configuration for easy setup. Its flexibility, scalability, and efficiency make it ideal for rapid development and maintenance.

You always want to keep your Application file at the top of your other file(Entity, Controller, etc) as your application file is read first and then your other files which saves you from a lot of unnecessary problems.
